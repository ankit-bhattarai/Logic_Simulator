The aim of this project is to develop a logic simulator program in Python. The program does the following:
1. Read a text file that describes a logic circuit and follows the rules of the specified logic description language,
2. Display syntax or semantic errors of the text file in the terminal or GUI if there is any,
3. Display the monitored signals,
4. Execute commands by the user (see user guide). 

Some of the code files are not PEP 8 compliant because the maximum number of characters on the same line exceeds the required
limit. This is intentional for the purpose of readability.
